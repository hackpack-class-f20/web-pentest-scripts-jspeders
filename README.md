## Environment Overview

_Explain your pentest environment here, your scripts and how they work_

My pentest environment is Burp and chrome/ chromium. I did my best to mock the setup from class. I installed Burp suite on my Windows computer. To start my environment I open Burp from the windows start menu. I use the embedded browser in burp and did not create any scripts to use it.
